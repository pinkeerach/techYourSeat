      <h2>Our Movement</h2>

      <p>We are a coalition of the Charlotte women in tech meetups whose goal is to cultivate a centralized movement of increased
        diversity in the Charlotte community. As part of this movement, we are supporting adult women at varying points in
        their career.
      </p>
      <p>Whether you are just entering the workforce, embarking on a second or third career, or have been in tech for a while,
        we are here to support and inspire you. Advocates are a crucial part of this movement, which is why we also welcome
        and support WIT and STEM advocates.
      </p>
      <p>Through this movement, we intend to bring to light the value of increasing womenâ€™s involvement in the tech community.
        To do this, we are bringing the various groups together to provide a large network of resources for diversity & inclusion.
      </p>
      <p>Most importantly, we want to create safe spaces where people are inspired to ask questions and seek out help. No one
        has to go it alone.
      </p>
      <p>Come to the table and #techYourSeat.</p>
